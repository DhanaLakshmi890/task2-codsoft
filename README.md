The Contact Book Project is a Python application designed to help users manage and store contact information effectively. The application provides basic functionalities to add, view, search, and delete contacts. This project is ideal for those looking to learn more about Python programming concepts such as file handling, user input, data management, and console-based applications.

Project Overview
The Contact Book application allows users to store details about their contacts, including names, phone numbers, and email addresses. The data is managed in a structured format that can be easily accessed and modified, providing a simple yet effective way to keep track of personal or professional contacts.

Features

Data Persistence: Contacts are stored in a text file or a database (e.g., SQLite), ensuring data persistence across sessions.
Console-Based Interface: A simple, user-friendly command-line interface that guides users through the available options and operations.
Project Structure
The Contact Book application is structured as a single Python script with separate functions to handle each operation (e.g., add, view, search, delete). This modular design allows for easy modification and extension of the program.
